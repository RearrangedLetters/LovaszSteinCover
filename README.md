# Lovasz Stein Graph Covering

## Set Up
This project has a couple of dependencies. 
For creating the animations used in the presentation, please make sure
Manim Community and the necessary dependencies are installed.
To achieve this, check the section for your operating system in the
[Manim Installation Guide](docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

All scripts are written to be run in a Linux terminal.
If you're working on a different operating system there might be additional steps.
Otherwise, you can run compile_latex in the folder Presentation to compile the presentation,
including a bibliography.
To recreate the images rendered with manim, execute run_manim in the folder Animations.
